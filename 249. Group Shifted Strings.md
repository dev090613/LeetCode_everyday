Note: Modulo operator % behaves differently in C++/Java and Python. The difference lies in the operator implementation.

C++/Java: a % b = a - int(a / b) * b
Python: a % b = a - floor(a / b) * b
In C++/Java expression like (a - b) % c can be negative if a < b hence we need to manually add c to make it non-negative (a - b + c) % c. On the other hand, Python automatically performs this step.
